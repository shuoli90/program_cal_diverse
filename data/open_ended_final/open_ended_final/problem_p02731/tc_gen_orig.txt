Sure! Here is a test case generator for the given problem statement:

```python
import random

def tcgen():
    # Generate a random integer L within the given constraints (1 ≤ L ≤ 1000)
    L = random.randint(1, 1000)
    
    return L

# Example usage:
for _ in range(10):  # Generate 10 random test cases
    print(tcgen())
```

This function `tcgen` generates a random integer `L` within the range of 1 to 1000, inclusive. You can use this to create multiple test cases for the problem. Each call to `tcgen` will produce a new value for `L` which you can then use as input for testing your solution to the problem.
