Problem Statement
Takahashi has N cards. The i-th of these cards has an integer A_i written on it.
Takahashi will choose an integer K, and then repeat the following operation some number of times:
Choose exactly K cards such that the integers written on them are all different, and eat those cards. (The eaten cards disappear.)
For each K = 1,2, \ldots, N, find the maximum number of times Takahashi can do the operation.
Constraints
 1 \le N \le 3 \times 10^5 
 1 \le A_i \le N 
All values in input are integers.
Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
Output
Print N integers.
The t-th (1 \le t \le N) of them should be the answer for the case K=t.

For K = 1, we can do the operation as follows:
Choose the first card to eat.
Choose the second card to eat.
Choose the third card to eat.
For K = 2, we can do the operation as follows:
Choose the first and second cards to eat.
For K = 3, we cannot do the operation at all. Note that we cannot choose the first and third cards at the same time.
