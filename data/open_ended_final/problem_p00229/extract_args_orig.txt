Sure, let's break this down into two parts: extracting the arguments from the input file and writing a function to process those arguments.

### Extract Arguments Function

First, we need a function to read the input data and extract the arguments. Since the input consists of multiple datasets and ends with a line of two zeros, we'll read until we encounter that termination condition.

Here's the function to extract the arguments:

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    datasets = []
    while True:
        line = fh.readline().strip()
        if line == "0 0 0 0 0 0":
            break
        b, r, g, c, s, t = map(int, line.split())
        datasets.append((b, r, g, c, s, t))
    return datasets
```

### Processing Function

Next, we'll write the function to process the list of tuples. The function will compute the remaining medals for each dataset based on the provided rules.

Given the problem statement:

- Each big bonus (b) allows 5 bonus games.
- Each regular bonus (r) allows 3 bonus games.
- Each grape match (g) gives 15 medals.
- Each play costs 2 medals.

With initial 100 medals, we need to compute the remaining medals after processing all games.

```python
def f(datasets):
    for b, r, g, c, s, t in datasets:
        initial_medals = 100

        # Total bonus games
        total_bonus_games = b * 5 + r * 3
        
        # Medals earned from grapes
        medals_from_grapes = g * 15
        
        # Total games played (including bonus games)
        total_games = t
        
        # Total cost of medals for all games
        total_cost = total_games * 2
        
        # Remaining medals calculation
        remaining_medals = initial_medals + medals_from_grapes - total_cost
        
        print(remaining_medals)
```

### Main Script

Now, we'll combine these parts into a main script that reads from an input file and processes the data.

```python
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        datasets = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(datasets)
```

### Summary

The `extract_arguments(fh)` function reads the input data and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a dataset with the format `(b, r, g, c, s, t)`. The `f(datasets)` function then processes each dataset and computes the remaining medals after all games are played.

This structure allows you to easily test the functions with different input files and ensures the logic is clearly separated.
