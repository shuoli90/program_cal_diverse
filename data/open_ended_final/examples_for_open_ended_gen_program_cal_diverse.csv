An integer \(H\) (1 ≤ \(H\) ≤ 100), representing some quantity or height.
An integer \(W\) (1 ≤ \(W\) ≤ 8), representing another quantity or width.
An integer \(K\) (1 ≤ \(K\) ≤ \(W\)), representing yet another quantity or index.

### Example Input:

```
3
2
3
```

### Function Signature:
Write a function `f(H, W, K)` that takes in the input.
```python
def f(H: int, W: int, K: int):
    '''
    H: an integer
    W: an integer
    K: an integer
    '''
