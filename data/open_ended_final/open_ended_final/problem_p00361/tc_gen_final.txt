### Explanation:
#1. **N (number of cities)**: Randomly choose a value between 1 and \(10^4\).
#2. **M (number of roads)**: Randomly choose a value between 0 and \(10^5\).
#3. **Generating roads**:
#   - A set `roads` is used to avoid duplicate roads.
#   - For each road, randomly generate a start city `s` and a destination city `t` ensuring `s â‰  t`.
#4. **Output Format**:
#   - The number of cities and roads is printed first.
#   - Each road is then printed in the form "s t".
