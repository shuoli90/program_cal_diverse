    # Read the first line from the file handle and split it into components
    line = fh.readline().strip()

#    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
#        n, k, x0 = extract_arguments(fh)
#    f(n, k, x0)

### Explanation:
#1. **extract_arguments Function**:
#    - Reads a single line from the input file.
#   - Splits the line into three components: `n`, `k`, and `x0`.
#    - Converts these components to integers and returns them as a tuple.
