To tackle the problem, we need to first extract the arguments from the input file and then define the function to process these arguments. Let's start by writing the `extract_arguments` function and then proceed to define the function `f` that processes the arguments.

### `extract_arguments` Function

The `extract_arguments` function will read the input from a file handle and parse it into the appropriate format. Here, the input consists of an integer \(N\) followed by \(N\) pairs of integers \(A[i]\) and \(B[i]\).

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    N = int(fh.readline().strip())
    AB = []
    for _ in range(N):
        A, B = map(int, fh.readline().strip().split())
        AB.append((A, B))
    return N, AB
```

### `f` Function

The function `f` will take the parsed arguments and process them according to the problem statement. Let's define this function with the signature `f(N, AB)` where:
- `N` is the number of vertices.
- `AB` is a list of tuples, each containing the distances \(A[i]\) and \(B[i]\) from vertices 1 and 2 respectively.

To determine whether the graph exists and to find the minimum possible number of edges, we need to implement the logic as described in the problem statement.

Here is an example of how the `f` function might look like:

```python
def f(N, AB):
    # Implement the logic to determine if the graph exists
    # and find the minimum possible number of edges.
    
    # Placeholder for processing logic
    # This should include checking the conditions and computing
    # the minimum number of edges or returning -1 if not possible.
    
    exists = True  # This should be determined by the actual logic
    min_edges = 0  # This should be the actual computed minimum number of edges

    if exists:
        print(min_edges)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Example Main Function

The main function will read the input from a file passed as a command-line argument and call the functions `extract_arguments` and `f`.

```python
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        N, AB = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(N, AB)
```

### Example Usage

Given an input file `input.txt` with the following content:

```
4
0 1
1 0
1 1
2 1
```

Running the script would look something like this:

```
$ python script.py input.txt
# Output would be determined by the logic inside the `f` function.
```

### Summary

1. **Extract Arguments**:
   - `extract_arguments(fh)` reads and parses the input file.
2. **Process Arguments**:
   - `f(N, AB)` processes the parsed arguments to check the existence of the graph and compute the minimum number of edges.
3. **Main Execution**:
   - Reads the input from the file, extracts the arguments, and processes them.

Make sure to replace the placeholder logic in `f` with the actual algorithm to solve the problem as described.
