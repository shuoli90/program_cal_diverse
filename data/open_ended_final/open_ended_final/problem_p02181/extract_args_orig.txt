Let's break down the problem statement and write the necessary functions to extract arguments from the input file and process them accordingly. We will follow the structure provided in the example.

### Extract Arguments Function
First, we will write a function that reads from a file handler and extracts the arguments \(N\) and the list of strings \(S\).

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    N = int(fh.readline().strip())
    S = [fh.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
    return N, S
```

### Processing Function
Next, we need to write a function that takes these arguments and processes them to find the maximum number of occurrences of the string "AOR" in any possible concatenation of the strings \(S_i\).

Here's a concrete function that processes the tuple (N, S):

```python
def count_aor_occurrences(N, S):
    from collections import Counter
    import itertools

    # We will count A's, O's, and R's in all strings
    total_counter = Counter()
    for string in S:
        total_counter.update(string)

    # The maximum number of "AOR" we can have is limited by the minimum count of A, O, and R
    max_aor = min(total_counter['A'], total_counter['O'], total_counter['R'])
    
    print(max_aor)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        N, S = extract_arguments(fh)
    count_aor_occurrences(N, S)
```

### Explanation
1. **extract_arguments Function**:
   - Reads the integer \(N\) from the first line.
   - Reads the next \(N\) lines to form the list of strings \(S\).

2. **count_aor_occurrences Function**:
   - Uses a counter to count the occurrences of 'A', 'O', and 'R' in all strings.
   - The maximum number of "AOR" substrings is determined by the minimum count among 'A', 'O', and 'R'.
   - Prints the result.

### Example Input and Output Handling
Given the input file as described in the problem statement:

```
2
AORA
OR
```

- The `extract_arguments` function will return \(N = 2\) and \(S = ['AORA', 'OR']\).
- The `count_aor_occurrences` function will then calculate the maximum occurrences of "AOR" in any concatenation of these strings and print `2`.

This approach ensures the solution runs efficiently even for the upper constraint limits.
