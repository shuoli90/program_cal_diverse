Problem StatementYou are given integers A and B, each between 1 and 3 (inclusive).
Determine if there is an integer C between 1 and 3 (inclusive) such that A \times B \times C is an odd number.
Constraints
All values in input are integers.
1 \leq A, B \leq 3
InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B
OutputIf there is an integer C between 1 and 3 that satisfies the condition, print Yes; otherwise, print No.
Sample Input 13 1
Sample Output 1Yes
Let C = 3. Then, A \times B \times C = 3 \times 1 \times 3 = 9, which is an odd number.
Sample Input 21 2
Sample Output 2No
Sample Input 32 2
Sample Output 3No
