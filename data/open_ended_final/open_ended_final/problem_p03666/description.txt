Problem StatementThere are N squares in a row.
The leftmost square contains the integer A, and the rightmost contains the integer B. The other squares are empty.
Aohashi would like to fill the empty squares with integers so that the following condition is satisfied:
For any two adjacent squares, the (absolute) difference of the two integers in those squares is between C and D (inclusive).
As long as the condition is satisfied, it is allowed to use arbitrarily large or small integers to fill the squares.
Determine whether it is possible to fill the squares under the condition.
Constraints
3 \leq N \leq 500000
0 \leq A \leq 10^9
0 \leq B \leq 10^9
0 \leq C \leq D \leq 10^9
All input values are integers.
InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N A B C D
OutputPrint YES if it is possible to fill the squares under the condition; print NO otherwise.
Sample Input 15 1 5 2 4
Sample Output 1YES
For example, fill the squares with the following integers: 1, -1, 3, 7, 5, from left to right.
