### Explanation:
#1. **N:** This is a random integer between 1 and 100,000, representing the number of strings.
#2. **S:** This is a list of N strings. Each string is composed of uppercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 20 characters.
#3. **Output:** The generated test case consists of N followed by N strings, each on a new line.
