### Canonicalized Input Description:

1. An integer \(N\) (1 ≤ \(N\) ≤ 10), representing some quantity or size.
2. An integer \(M\) (0 ≤ \(M\) ≤ 100000), representing another quantity or size.
3. A list of \(N\) integers, each representing a value, where each integer is between 1 and 100000.

The input consists of multiple data sets. Each dataset is described by two lines. The first line contains the integers \(N\) and \(M\). The second line contains \(N\) integers. The input is terminated by a dataset where \(N\) = \(M\) = 0, which should not be processed.

### Example Input:
```
6 330
1 5 10 50 100 500
7 127
1 2 4 8 16 32 64
2 10000
1000 2000
0 0
```

### Function Signature:
Write a function `f(inputs)` that takes in the input as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains:
- An integer \(N\)
- An integer \(M\)
- A list of \(N\) integers

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def f(inputs: List[Tuple[int, int, List[int]]]):
    '''
    inputs: a list of tuples, each containing:
        - an integer N
        - an integer M
        - a list of N integers
    '''
```
