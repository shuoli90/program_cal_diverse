### Input Description:

1. An integer \( N \) (1 ≤ \( N \) ≤ 10000), representing some quantity or size.

### Example Input:

```
1000

```

### Function Signature:

Write a function `f(N)` that takes in the input.
```python
def f(N: int):
    '''
    N: an integer
    '''

Now please implement the function f; do not return anything, the function f should print the result of the operation.
It should terminate within 30 seconds. First describe the function you would write, then implement it.

The following function will print out the square of the input number. We will take the square using the ** operator in Python within the print statement.

def f(N: int):
    print(n**2)

### Input Description:

1. A floating point number \( N \) (1 ≤ \( N \) ≤ 10000), representing some quantity or size.

### Example Input:

```
143.23
```

### Function Signature:
Write a function `f(N)` that takes in the input.
```python
def f(N: float):
    '''
    N: a float
    '''

Now please implement the function f; do not return anything, the function f should print the result of the operation.
It should terminate within 30 seconds. First describe the function you would write, then implement it.

The following function will calculate the number of times the input number can be divided by 2 before it becomes less than 1. We will increment a counter variable i each time we divide the number by 2 inside a while loop.

def f(N: float):
    i = 0
    while N > 1:
        N = N / 2
        i += 1
    print(i)

## DESCRIPTION 

Now please implement the function f; do not return anything, the function f should print the result of the operation.
It should terminate within 30 seconds. First describe the function you would write, then implement it.
