Sure, let's start by writing the extract arguments function for the given problem statement. After that, we will write the function to process the arguments and determine the output based on the problem requirements.

### Extract Arguments Function

First, let's create the function to read the inputs from a file:

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    A, B = map(int, fh.readline().strip().split())
    return A, B
```

### Processing Function

Now, let's write the function that processes the tuple `(A, B)` and determines if there exists an integer `C` between 1 and 3 such that `A * B * C` is an odd number:

```python
def f(A, B):
    for C in range(1, 4):
        if (A * B * C) % 2 == 1:
            print("Yes")
            return
    print("No")
```

### Main Script

Finally, let's combine these functions into a script that reads from an input file, extracts the arguments, and processes them:

```python
import sys

def extract_arguments(fh):
    A, B = map(int, fh.readline().strip().split())
    return A, B

def f(A, B):
    for C in range(1, 4):
        if (A * B * C) % 2 == 1:
            print("Yes")
            return
    print("No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        A, B = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(A, B)
```

### Summary

- The `extract_arguments` function reads the input values from the file.
- The `f` function processes these values to determine if there is an integer `C` that makes the product `A * B * C` odd.
- The main script reads the input file path from the command line, extracts the arguments, and then calls the processing function.

This setup ensures that the program can be easily tested with different input files by passing the file path as a command line argument.
