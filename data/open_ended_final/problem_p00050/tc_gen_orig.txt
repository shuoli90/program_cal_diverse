Sure, I can help with that. The test case generator for the "Apples and Peaches" problem needs to create random lines of English text with a length of 1000 characters or less, including alphanumeric characters, spaces, and symbols. The text should contain occurrences of the words "apple" and "peach" to ensure the test cases are meaningful.

Here's a Python function that generates such test cases:

```python
import random
import string

def generate_random_word():
    length = random.randint(1, 10)
    letters = string.ascii_lowercase
    return ''.join(random.choice(letters) for i in range(length))

def tcgen():
    max_length = 1000
    words = []
    current_length = 0
    
    # Ensure we include "apple" and "peach" at least once
    words.append("apple")
    words.append("peach")
    current_length += len("apple") + len("peach") + 2  # +2 for spaces
    
    while current_length < max_length:
        word = generate_random_word()
        if current_length + len(word) + 1 > max_length:
            break
        words.append(word)
        current_length += len(word) + 1
    
    random.shuffle(words)
    
    text = ' '.join(words)
    return text

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_input = tcgen()
    print(f"Input: {test_input}")
```

This function generates a random line of text with a length of up to 1000 characters. It ensures that the words "apple" and "peach" are included at least once. The function uses `generate_random_word` to create random words of length between 1 and 10 characters, constructs the text, shuffles the words, and joins them into a single string.

The `tcgen` function returns a string that can be used as a test input. You can run the script and see the generated test case.

Feel free to modify the function to better suit any specific needs or constraints you might have.
