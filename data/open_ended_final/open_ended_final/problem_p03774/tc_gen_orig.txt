Sure, I can help you write a test case generator for the given problem. Here's a Python function that generates random test cases for the problem statement you provided:

```python
import random

def tcgen():
    # Constants
    MIN_COORD = -10**8
    MAX_COORD = 10**8
    
    # Random values for N and M within given constraints
    N = random.randint(1, 50)
    M = random.randint(1, 50)
    
    # Generate random coordinates for N students
    students = [(random.randint(MIN_COORD, MAX_COORD), random.randint(MIN_COORD, MAX_COORD)) for _ in range(N)]
    
    # Generate random coordinates for M checkpoints
    checkpoints = [(random.randint(MIN_COORD, MAX_COORD), random.randint(MIN_COORD, MAX_COORD)) for _ in range(M)]
    
    return N, M, students, checkpoints

def print_test_case(N, M, students, checkpoints):
    print(f"{N} {M}")
    for (a, b) in students:
        print(f"{a} {b}")
    for (c, d) in checkpoints:
        print(f"{c} {d}")

# Example usage
N, M, students, checkpoints = tcgen()
print_test_case(N, M, students, checkpoints)
```

This script generates a test case by:
1. Randomly selecting values for \( N \) (number of students) and \( M \) (number of checkpoints) within the given constraints.
2. Randomly generating coordinates for each student and each checkpoint within the range \([-10^8, 10^8]\).

The `print_test_case` function is then used to print the generated test case in the required format.

You can run this script to generate random test cases for your problem statement. Each time you run the script, it will print a different test case. If you want to generate multiple test cases at once, you can simply call the `tcgen` function multiple times in a loop.
