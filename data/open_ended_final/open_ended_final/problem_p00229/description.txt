Ataru Ookoshi, a student at Aizu Gakuin University High School, decided to play a slot machine.
When you insert a medal into this machine, three reels start to rotate and each reel stops automatically. For a normal game, three medals are inserted and medals are obtained according to the symbols when the symbols match.
Depending on how the symbols match, special services will start. If three 7 symbols match, the big bonus will start, and you can play the bonus game for 5 games. Also, if three BAR symbols match, the regular bonus will start, and you can play the bonus game for 3 games.
When three star symbols match, a free game starts, and you cannot get medals, but you can start the next game without inserting medals.
During the bonus game, if you insert 2 medals per game, the grape symbols will automatically match and you can get 15 medals.
Ataru Ookoshi started playing with 100 medals at the machine. After playing for a while, it ended in a normal game. How many medals were left in his hand?
