Sure, let's start by writing the function to extract the arguments from the input file. Following that, we will write the function to process these arguments.

### Extract Arguments Function

Based on the problem statement, the input consists of an integer \(N\) followed by a list of \(N\) integers representing the cards.

Here's the `extract_arguments` function:

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    N = int(fh.readline().strip())
    A = list(map(int, fh.readline().strip().split()))
    return N, A

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        N, A = extract_arguments(fh)
    # Example usage of f(N, A)
    f(N, A)
```

### Processing Function

Next, let's write the function to process these arguments. We need to find the maximum number of times Takahashi can perform the operation for each \( K \) from 1 to \( N \).

Here is the function `f(N, A)`:

```python
def f(N, A):
    from collections import Counter

    # Count the frequency of each card value
    count = Counter(A)
    
    # Frequency of frequencies
    freq_of_freq = Counter(count.values())
    
    # Prepare the result array
    result = [0] * N
    
    # To accumulate the number of times we can choose K cards
    current_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate from 1 to N to cover all possible K values
    for K in range(1, N + 1):
        if K in freq_of_freq:
            current_sum += freq_of_freq[K]
        
        result[K - 1] = current_sum // K
    
    # Print the result as required
    for res in result:
        print(res)

# Example of running the function directly with inputs
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        N, A = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(N, A)
```

### Explanation

- **extract_arguments**: This function reads the input file, parses the integer \(N\) and the list of integers \(A\), and returns them.
- **f(N, A)**: This function processes the given arguments:
  - It counts the frequency of each card value using `Counter`.
  - It counts the frequency of those frequencies.
  - It iterates from 1 to \( N \) to find the maximum number of times Takahashi can perform the operation for each \( K \).
  - For each \( K \), it prints the result.

This code will handle the input and process it as required by the problem statement. You can save this script in a file and run it with the input file path as an argument to see the results.
