Certainly! The problem statement you provided involves creating a test case generator for a problem that deals with constructing a road network in such a way that you can travel all roads, ensuring a roundtrip is possible from any city.

Here’s a possible test case generator for the "Road Improvement" problem:

```python
import random

def tcgen():
    N = random.randint(1, 10**4)  # Number of cities
    M = random.randint(0, 10**5)  # Number of roads

    roads = set()
    while len(roads) < M:
        s = random.randint(0, N-1)
        t = random.randint(0, N-1)
        if s != t:
            roads.add((s, t))
    
    roads = list(roads)
    
    test_case = f"{N} {len(roads)}\n"
    for s, t in roads:
        test_case += f"{s} {t}\n"
    
    return test_case.strip()

# Example usage
print(tcgen())
```

### Explanation:
1. **N (number of cities)**: Randomly choose a value between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. **M (number of roads)**: Randomly choose a value between 0 and \(10^5\).
3. **Generating roads**:
   - A set `roads` is used to avoid duplicate roads.
   - For each road, randomly generate a start city `s` and a destination city `t` ensuring `s ≠ t`.
4. **Output Format**:
   - The number of cities and roads is printed first.
   - Each road is then printed in the form "s t".

### Note:
- This generator ensures that no duplicate roads are generated, as we store them in a set.
- The generator produces random but valid test cases within the problem constraints.

You can use this generator to create multiple test cases for testing purposes.
