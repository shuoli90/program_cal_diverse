Score : 1900 points
Problem StatementThere is a tree with N vertices.
The vertices are numbered 1 through N.
For each 1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1, the i-th edge connects vertices a_i and b_i.
The lengths of all the edges are 1.
Snuke likes some of the vertices.
The information on his favorite vertices are given to you as a string s of length N.
For each 1 ≤ i ≤ N, s_i is 1 if Snuke likes vertex i, and 0 if he does not like vertex i.
Initially, all the vertices are white.
Snuke will perform the following operation exactly once:
Select a vertex v that he likes, and a non-negative integer d. Then, paint all the vertices black whose distances from v are at most d.
Find the number of the possible combinations of colors of the vertices after the operation.
Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5
1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N
The given graph is a tree.
