Sure, let's start by writing the function to extract the arguments from the input file and then the function to process these arguments based on the problem statement provided.

### Extract Arguments Function

First, we'll create the `extract_arguments` function that reads the inputs from a file handle and returns the values as a tuple `(N, A, B, C, D)`.

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    # Read the line and split it into individual components
    line = fh.readline().strip().split()
    
    # Convert the components to integers
    N = int(line[0])
    A = int(line[1])
    B = int(line[2])
    C = int(line[3])
    D = int(line[4])
    
    # Return as a tuple
    return N, A, B, C, D
```

### Process Arguments Function

Now, we'll write the function `f` that processes the tuple `(N, A, B, C, D)` and determines if it is possible to fill the squares under the given conditions.

```python
def f(N, A, B, C, D):
    # Check the condition if it is possible to fill the squares under the constraints
    # The key insight is whether the difference between A and B can be bridged using steps
    # within the range [C, D]

    # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible differences achievable with N-1 steps
    min_possible_diff = (N - 1) * C
    max_possible_diff = (N - 1) * D

    # Calculate the absolute difference between A and B
    abs_diff = abs(A - B)

    # Check if abs_diff is within the range of [min_possible_diff, max_possible_diff]
    if min_possible_diff <= abs_diff <= max_possible_diff:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```

### Main Function to Read Input and Execute

Finally, we put it all together in a main block to read from the input file and call the appropriate functions.

```python
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        N, A, B, C, D = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(N, A, B, C, D)
```

### Summary

- `extract_arguments(fh)` reads the input from a file and returns the values as a tuple.
- `f(N, A, B, C, D)` processes the tuple to determine if the squares can be filled according to the given conditions.
- The main block reads the input file and calls these functions.
