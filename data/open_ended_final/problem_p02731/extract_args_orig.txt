Sure, let's start by writing the function to extract the argument from the input for the given problem statement. Then we'll write the function that processes the argument to find the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid whose sum of the dimensions is \( L \).

### Extract Arguments Function

First, let's define the function to extract the argument from the input file.

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    L = int(fh.readline().strip())
    return L
```

### Processing Function

Next, we'll write the function `f(L)` that processes the input \( L \) to find the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid whose sum of the dimensions is \( L \). To achieve the maximum volume, we need to divide the \( L \) equally into 3 parts, as the product of three equal numbers is maximized when the numbers are equal.

```python
def f(L):
    # To maximize the volume, the dimensions should be as equal as possible.
    a = b = c = L / 3
    max_volume = a * b * c
    print(f"{max_volume:.12f}")
```

### Putting It All Together

Finally, let's combine the extraction function and the processing function in a script that reads from the input file.

```python
import sys

def extract_arguments(fh):
    L = int(fh.readline().strip())
    return L

def f(L):
    # To maximize the volume, the dimensions should be as equal as possible.
    a = b = c = L / 3
    max_volume = a * b * c
    print(f"{max_volume:.12f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh: 
        L = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(L)
```

### Explanation

- The `extract_arguments` function reads the integer \( L \) from the input file.
- The function `f(L)` calculates the maximum possible volume by dividing \( L \) into three equal parts.
- The script reads the input from a file specified in the command line, extracts the argument, and processes it to print the maximum volume with a precision up to 12 decimal places.

This solution ensures the volume is maximized by making the dimensions as equal as possible, which is a known mathematical principle for maximizing the product of numbers given their sum.
