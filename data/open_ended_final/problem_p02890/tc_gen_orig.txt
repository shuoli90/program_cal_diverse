Sure, I can help you write a test case generator for the given competitive programming problem. Here is the Python function that generates random test cases for the problem:

```python
import random

def tcgen():
    # Generate a random integer N where 1 ≤ N ≤ 3 * 10^5
    N = random.randint(1, 3 * 10**5)
    
    # Generate a list A of size N where each integer A_i (1 ≤ A_i ≤ N)
    A = [random.randint(1, N) for _ in range(N)]
    
    return N, A

# Example usage:
N, A = tcgen()
print(N)
print(' '.join(map(str, A)))
```

Explanation:
1. We generate a random integer `N` in the range [1, 300000].
2. We then generate a list `A` of size `N` with each element being a random integer in the range [1, N].

This ensures that the constraints of the problem are respected. The generated test cases can be printed or used directly in a competitive programming environment.
