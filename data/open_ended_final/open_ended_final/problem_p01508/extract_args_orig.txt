Sure, let's break down the task into two main parts:
1. **Extracting arguments from the input file**.
2. **Processing the extracted arguments** to find the longest possible track.

### Part 1: Extracting Arguments

We need to write a function, `extract_arguments`, which reads the input file and extracts the test cases. Each test case consists of an integer \(N\) followed by \(N\) lines of coordinates, and the input ends with a line containing "0".

### Part 2: Processing the Arguments

We need another function, `f`, to process each test case and calculate the maximum possible length of the racetrack within the given polygon.

Here's the code for both parts:

```python
import sys
import math

def extract_arguments(fh):
    # Read all lines from the file handle
    lines = fh.readlines()
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store all test cases
    test_cases = []
    
    index = 0
    case_number = 1
    
    while index < len(lines):
        # Read the number of vertices
        N = int(lines[index].strip())
        
        if N == 0:
            break
        
        index += 1
        vertices = []
        
        # Read the N vertices
        for _ in range(N):
            x, y = map(int, lines[index].strip().split())
            vertices.append((x, y))
            index += 1
        
        # Append the extracted test case to the list
        test_cases.append((case_number, N, vertices))
        case_number += 1
    
    return test_cases

# Function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points
def euclidean_distance(p1, p2):
    return math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])**2)

def f(test_cases):
    results = []
    
    for case_number, N, vertices in test_cases:
        max_distance = 0
        
        # Compare all pairs of vertices to find the maximum distance
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i + 1, N):
                distance = euclidean_distance(vertices[i], vertices[j])
                if distance > max_distance:
                    max_distance = distance
        
        results.append(f"Case {case_number}: {max_distance:.8f}")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        test_cases = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(test_cases)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Extracting Arguments**:
   - `extract_arguments` reads the input file line by line.
   - It constructs a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple `(case_number, N, vertices)`.
   - Each test case ends when we reach "0" in the input.

2. **Processing the Arguments**:
   - `f` processes each test case to find the maximum possible length of the racetrack.
   - It calculates the maximum Euclidean distance between every pair of vertices in the polygon.
   - The results are printed in the required format with a precision of 8 decimal places.

This approach ensures that we can handle multiple test cases and perform the required geometric calculations efficiently.
