Sure, let's start by writing the function to extract the arguments from the input file for the given problem statement. Following that, we'll define a function that processes the input tuple (N, T) to compute the shortest time required to transport all the boats.

### Extract Arguments Function

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    N = int(fh.readline().strip())
    T = list(map(int, fh.readline().strip().split()))
    return N, T
```

### Function to Process the Arguments

To solve the problem, we need to figure out the optimal way to transport all the boats. The strategy involves always trying to minimize the maximum time taken when transporting two boats at a time.

```python
def f(N, T):
    T.sort()
    total_time = 0
    while len(T) > 3:
        # Two strategies
        # 1. Send two fastest then bring one fastest back
        time_strategy_1 = 2 * T[1] + T[0] + T[-1]
        # 2. Send two slowest then bring fastest back
        time_strategy_2 = 2 * T[0] + T[-2] + T[-1]
        total_time += min(time_strategy_1, time_strategy_2)
        T.pop()  # Remove the slowest boat
        T.pop()  # Remove second slowest boat

    # Base cases
    if len(T) == 1:
        total_time += T[0]
    elif len(T) == 2:
        total_time += T[1]
    elif len(T) == 3:
        total_time += T[0] + T[1] + T[2]

    print(total_time)

# If the inputs are a list of such tuples, we adjust the function signature
def f(inputs):
    for N, T in inputs:
        f(N, T)
```

### Main Function to Read Input and Invoke Processing Function

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        N, T = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(N, T)
```

### Explanation

1. **extract_arguments Function:** This function reads from a file handle `fh`, parses the integer `N`, and the list of integers `T`, and returns them as a tuple.
2. **f Function:** This function takes `N` (number of boats) and `T` (list of times) as arguments and calculates the minimum time required to transport all the boats.
3. **Optimal Strategy:** We always try to minimize the maximum time taken by sorting the list and comparing two strategies:
   - Sending the two fastest first, then bringing one back, and sending the two slowest.
   - Sending the two slowest first, then bringing one fastest back, and sending the two fastest.
4. **Base Cases:** Handle scenarios when there are 1, 2, or 3 boats left after the main loop.

This solution ensures that we always take the optimal approach depending on the current state of the sorted list of times, leading to the minimum total transportation time.
