Sure! Below is a test case generator for the given problem statement:

```python
import random

def tcgen():
    datasets = []
    
    for _ in range(random.randint(1, 120)):
        # b, r, g, c, s are integers between 0 and 200
        b = random.randint(0, 200)
        r = random.randint(0, 200)
        g = random.randint(0, 200)
        c = random.randint(0, 200)
        s = random.randint(0, 200)
        # t is an integer less than or equal to 1000
        t = random.randint(1, 1000)
        
        datasets.append(f"{b} {r} {g} {c} {s} {t}")
        
    # Append the end of input marker
    datasets.append("0 0 0 0 0 0")
    
    return datasets

# Generate a sample test case
sample_test_case = tcgen()
for data in sample_test_case:
    print(data)
```

### Explanation:
1. This script generates a list of datasets. Each dataset contains six integers: `b`, `r`, `g`, `c`, `s`, and `t`.
2. The integers `b`, `r`, `g`, `c`, `s` are randomly chosen between 0 and 200 (inclusive).
3. The integer `t` is randomly chosen between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
4. The outer loop runs a random number of times between 1 and 120 to simulate multiple datasets.
5. Finally, a line "0 0 0 0 0 0" is added to mark the end of input.

You can use the generated test cases to validate your solution for the given problem.
