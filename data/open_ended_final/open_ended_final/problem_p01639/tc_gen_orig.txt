Given the problem statement for Problem F: MLE, we need to generate test cases for a pseudo-random sequence followed by sorting and selecting a specific element. Here’s a test case generator for the given problem:

```python
import random

def tcgen():
    # Generating n, k, and x0 based on given constraints
    n = random.randint(1, 10**8)  # 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^8
    k = random.randint(1, n)  # 1 ≤ k ≤ n
    x0 = random.randint(0, 9)  # 0 ≤ x0 ≤ 9
    
    return n, k, x0

# Example usage of the generator
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, k, x0 = tcgen()
    print(f"{n} {k} {x0}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Generating `n`**: We randomly select `n` between 1 and \(10^8\) inclusive, which defines the length of the pseudo-random sequence.
2. **Generating `k`**: We randomly select `k` between 1 and `n` inclusive, which is the index we need to find in the sorted sequence.
3. **Generating `x0`**: We randomly select `x0` between 0 and 9 inclusive, which is the initial value for generating the pseudo-random sequence.

### Example Run:

Suppose we run the generator, it might output:
```
75839274 1839201 5
```

This indicates:
- `n = 75839274`
- `k = 1839201`
- `x0 = 5`

### Note:

- This generator doesn't actually produce the pseudo-random sequence, sort it, and find the \( k \)-th element because the problem constraints (up to \(10^8\) elements) make it infeasible to run such a large-scale computation as part of the test case generation.
- The generator focuses on producing the input parameters for the problem, which can be used in competitive programming environments to test implementations for correctness and efficiency.

This should help in generating the required test cases for the problem statement provided.
