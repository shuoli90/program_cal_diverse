Road Improvement
Aizu is a country famous for its rich tourism resources and has N cities, each of which is uniquely identified with a number (0 to N-1). It has a road network consisting of M one-way roads connecting a city to another.
  All the roads connecting the cities in Aizu have a row of cherry trees along their routes. For enhancing the cherry-viewing experience, a proposal was made to modify the road network so that a tourist can travel around all the roads. To achieve this target, it was decided to construct several one-way roads, each connecting two cities and abiding by the following rules.
The newly constructed road is for one-way traffic
Starting from any city, a tourist is able to make a roundtrip and return to the city, whereby he/she drives all the roads exhaustively, including the newly constructed ones. Multiple passages of some of the roads are allowed.
  You, as a tourism promotion officer, are assigned with the task of writing a program for the road construction project.
  Write a program to determine the minimum number of roads to be constructed given the road network information in Aizu.
Input
  The input is given in the following format.
N M
s_1 t_1
s_2 t_2
:
s_M t_M
The first line provides the number of cities N (1 ≤ N ≤ 104) and roads M (0 ≤ M ≤ 105). Each of the subsequent M lines provides the numbers assigned to start and destination cities for the i-th road: s_i, t_i (0 ≤ s_i, t_i ≤ N-1) , where s_i ≠ t_i. (no duplicate appearance of a road)
  
Output
  Output the minimum number of roads to be newly constructed.
