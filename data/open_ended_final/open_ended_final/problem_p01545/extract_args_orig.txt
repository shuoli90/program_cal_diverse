### Extract Arguments Function and Problem Processing Function

Let's start by writing the `extract_arguments` function to read and parse the input for the problem statement. This function will extract the number of luggage pieces (`n`) and their respective weights (`x1, x2, ..., xn`) from the input file.

After that, we'll write a function `f` that processes the inputs and calculates the minimum total physical strength required to arrange the luggage from the lightest to the heaviest.

### Extract Arguments Function

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    n = int(fh.readline().strip())
    weights = list(map(int, fh.readline().strip().split()))
    return n, weights
```

### Processing Function

Here, the processing function will calculate the minimum total physical strength required to arrange the luggage from lightest to heaviest.

```python
def f(n, weights):
    # Sort the weights to get the target order
    sorted_weights = sorted(weights)
    
    # Initialize the total physical strength required
    total_strength = 0
    
    # Create an index map to find the current position of each weight
    current_positions = {weight: i for i, weight in enumerate(weights)}
    
    # Iterate over the sorted weights and calculate the strength required to move them
    for i, weight in enumerate(sorted_weights):
        current_index = current_positions[weight]
        
        # Add the weight to the total strength required
        total_strength += weight
        
        # Move the weight to the correct position in the array
        weights.pop(current_index)
        weights.insert(i, weight)
        
        # Update the current positions of the weights
        for j in range(i, n):
            current_positions[weights[j]] = j
    
    print(total_strength)
```

### Main Function

Let's write the main function to read the input file and call the above functions.

```python
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        n, weights = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(n, weights)
```

### Usage

- Save the above code in a Python file, e.g., `moving_luggage.py`.
- Ensure the input file is formatted correctly and provide its path when running the script.

```bash
python moving_luggage.py input.txt
```

This will read the input from `input.txt`, process it using the `extract_arguments` and `f` functions, and print the minimum total physical strength required to arrange the luggage.
