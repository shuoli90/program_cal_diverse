Sure, let's start by writing the function to extract the arguments from the input file for the "Apples and Peaches" problem. Since this problem only has a single line of text as input, we will simply read that line. Then, we'll write the function that processes the input to swap "apple" and "peach".

### Extract Arguments Function

First, the function to extract the single line of text from the file:

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    text = fh.readline().strip()
    return text
```

### Processing Function

Next, the function to process the input and swap "apple" and "peach":

```python
def f(text):
    # First, we replace all occurrences of "apple" with a placeholder
    text = text.replace("apple", "__placeholder__")
    # Next, we replace all occurrences of "peach" with "apple"
    text = text.replace("peach", "apple")
    # Finally, we replace the placeholder with "peach"
    text = text.replace("__placeholder__", "peach")
    print(text)
```

### Main Function

Finally, the main part of the program that ties everything together:

```python
import sys

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        text = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(text)
```

### Complete Code

Here is the complete code:

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    text = fh.readline().strip()
    return text

def f(text):
    # First, we replace all occurrences of "apple" with a placeholder
    text = text.replace("apple", "__placeholder__")
    # Next, we replace all occurrences of "peach" with "apple"
    text = text.replace("peach", "apple")
    # Finally, we replace the placeholder with "peach"
    text = text.replace("__placeholder__", "peach")
    print(text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        text = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(text)
```

This program will read the input from a file, process the text to swap "apple" and "peach", and print the modified text. The use of a placeholder ensures that the replacements do not interfere with each other.
