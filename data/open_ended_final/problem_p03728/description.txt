Problem StatementTakahashi loves sorting.
He has a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_N) of the integers from 1 through N. Now, he will repeat the following operation until the permutation becomes (1,2,...,N):
First, we will define high and low elements in the permutation, as follows. The i-th element in the permutation is high if the maximum element between the 1-st and i-th elements, inclusive, is the i-th element itself, and otherwise the i-th element is low.
Then, let a_1,a_2,...,a_k be the values of the high elements, and b_1,b_2,...,b_{N-k} be the values of the low elements in the current permutation, in the order they appear in it.
Lastly, rearrange the permutation into (b_1,b_2,...,b_{N-k},a_1,a_2,...,a_k).
How many operations are necessary until the permutation is sorted?
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5
(p_1,p_2,...,p_N) is a permutation of the integers from 1 through N.
InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
p_1 p_2 ... p_N
OutputPrint the number of operations that are necessary until the permutation is sorted.
Sample Input 15
3 5 1 2 4
Sample Output 13
The initial permutation is (3,5,1,2,4), and each operation changes it as follows:
In the first operation, the 1-st and 2-nd elements are high, and the 3-rd, 4-th and 5-th are low. The permutation becomes: (1,2,4,3,5).
In the second operation, the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd and 5-th elements are high, and the 4-th is low. The permutation becomes: (3,1,2,4,5).
In the third operation, the 1-st, 4-th and 5-th elements are high, and the 2-nd and 3-rd and 5-th are low. The permutation becomes: (1,2,3,4,5).
