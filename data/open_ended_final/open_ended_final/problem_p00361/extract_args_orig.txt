Sure, I can help you write the functions for extracting and processing the arguments for the given problem statement "Road Improvement." Let's start by writing the function to extract the arguments from the input file and then proceed to the function that processes these arguments.

### Step 1: Extract Arguments Function

This function will read from the input file and extract the number of cities \( N \), the number of roads \( M \), and the list of roads.

```python
def extract_arguments(fh):
    first_line = fh.readline().strip().split()
    N = int(first_line[0])
    M = int(first_line[1])
    roads = []
    for _ in range(M):
        s, t = map(int, fh.readline().strip().split())
        roads.append((s, t))
    return N, M, roads
```

### Step 2: Process Arguments Function

This function will implement the logic to determine the minimum number of new roads to be constructed so that a tourist can travel around all the roads and return to the starting city. 

For simplicity, let's outline the function signature and a placeholder for the logic:

```python
def f(N, M, roads):
    # Placeholder for the main logic to process the roads and determine the minimum number of new roads needed
    pass
```

### Integrating Both Functions

Here's the complete code integrating the argument extraction and processing functions:

```python
import sys

def extract_arguments(fh):
    first_line = fh.readline().strip().split()
    N = int(first_line[0])
    M = int(first_line[1])
    roads = []
    for _ in range(M):
        s, t = map(int, fh.readline().strip().split())
        roads.append((s, t))
    return N, M, roads

def f(N, M, roads):
    # Placeholder for the main logic to process the roads and determine the minimum number of new roads needed
    # For now, we just print the inputs to verify the extraction
    print(f"N: {N}, M: {M}")
    print("Roads:", roads)
    # Implement the main logic here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        N, M, roads = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(N, M, roads)
```

### Example Logic Implementation

To give a basic idea on how to implement the logic in `f`, here is a rough plan:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the cities and roads as a directed graph.
2. **Strongly Connected Components (SCC)**: Use algorithms like Kosaraju's or Tarjan's to find SCCs.
3. **Condensed Graph**: Build a new graph where each SCC is a single node.
4. **In-Degree and Out-Degree**: Calculate the in-degree and out-degree of each node in the condensed graph.
5. **Determine New Roads**: The number of new roads required will be the maximum of the number of nodes with zero in-degrees and the number of nodes with zero out-degrees.

For detailed implementation, algorithms for finding SCCs and graph traversal techniques would be necessary. Here is a simplified placeholder for the actual logic:

```python
def f(N, M, roads):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque
    
    def kosaraju_scc(N, edges):
        # Step 1: Create the graph and its transpose
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        reverse_graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            reverse_graph[v].append(u)
        
        # Step 2: Perform DFS on the original graph to get the finishing times
        visited = [False] * N
        stack = []
        
        def dfs1(node):
            visited[node] = True
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    dfs1(neighbor)
            stack.append(node)
        
        for i in range(N):
            if not visited[i]:
                dfs1(i)
        
        # Step 3: Perform DFS on the transpose graph in the order of decreasing finishing times
        visited = [False] * N
        sccs = []
        
        def dfs2(node, comp):
            visited[node] = True
            comp.append(node)
            for neighbor in reverse_graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    dfs2(neighbor, comp)
        
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            if not visited[node]:
                comp = []
                dfs2(node, comp)
                sccs.append(comp)
        
        return sccs
    
    sccs = kosaraju_scc(N, roads)

    if len(sccs) == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Create a condensed graph of SCCs
    scc_index = {}
    for i, scc in enumerate(sccs):
        for node in scc:
            scc_index[node] = i
    
    in_degree = [0] * len(sccs)
    out_degree = [0] * len(sccs)
    
    for u, v in roads:
        if scc_index[u] != scc_index[v]:
            out_degree[scc_index[u]] += 1
            in_degree[scc_index[v]] += 1
    
    zero_in = sum(1 for x in in_degree if x == 0)
    zero_out = sum(1 for x in out_degree if x == 0)
    
    print(max(zero_in, zero_out))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(input_path, 'r') as fh:
        N, M, roads = extract_arguments(fh)
    f(N, M, roads)
```

This implementation uses Kosaraju's algorithm to find strongly connected components and then constructs a condensed graph to determine the number of new roads needed. You can further refine the logic to ensure it works efficiently for the given constraints.
