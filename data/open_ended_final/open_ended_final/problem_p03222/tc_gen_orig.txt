Sure, I can help you write a test case generator for the Amidakuji problem. Below is the Python code to generate test cases for this problem:

```python
import random

def tcgen():
    H = random.randint(1, 100)  # Height of the amidakuji lines
    W = random.randint(1, 8)    # Number of vertical lines
    K = random.randint(1, W)    # Position of the vertical line to reach
    
    return H, W, K

# Example usage of the test case generator
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for _ in range(5):  # Generate 5 random test cases
        H, W, K = tcgen()
        print(f"Input: {H} {W} {K}")
```

### Explanation:
- **H** is randomly chosen between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- **W** is randomly chosen between 1 and 8 (inclusive).
- **K** is randomly chosen between 1 and W (inclusive).

This will ensure that the generated inputs adhere to the constraints provided in the problem statement. You can adjust the number of test cases by changing the range in the `for` loop. The `print` statement outputs the generated test cases in the required format.
