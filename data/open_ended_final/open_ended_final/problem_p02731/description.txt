Problem StatementGiven is a positive integer L.
Find the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid whose sum of the dimensions (not necessarily integers) is L.
Constraints
1 ≤ L ≤ 1000
L is an integer.
InputInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:
L
OutputPrint the maximum possible volume of a rectangular cuboid whose sum of the dimensions (not necessarily integers) is L.
Your output is considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.
Sample Input 13
Sample Output 11.000000000000
For example, a rectangular cuboid whose dimensions are 0.8, 1, and 1.2 has a volume of 0.96.
On the other hand, if the dimensions are 1, 1, and 1, the volume of the rectangular cuboid is 1, which is greater.
